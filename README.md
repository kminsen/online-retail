## Project Overview
This project provides insights into online retail data through:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing patterns and trends in the dataset.
- **RFM Analysis**: Segmenting customers based on their purchase behaviors.

The primary goal is to help businesses better understand customer segments to improve marketing strategies and customer relationship management.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project (`online_retail.xlsx`) includes transaction details from an online store. Key fields in the dataset are:
- Invoice number
- Stock code
- Description of the product
- Quantity of items purchased
- Invoice date
- Unit price of the item
- Customer ID
- Country of purchase

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA notebook (`eda.ipynb`) covers the following:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualizations of key metrics (e.g., sales trends, top-selling products, and customer behavior)
- Identifying missing values and outliers
- Distribution of key variables

## RFM Analysis
The RFM analysis notebook (`rfm.ipynb`) performs customer segmentation based on three key metrics:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends.

This analysis is commonly used to identify high-value customers and target marketing efforts more effectively.
